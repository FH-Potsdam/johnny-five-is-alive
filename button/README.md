======

Simple example using a button attached as pull up and socket.io to communicate with the client side.  


usage:  

    npm install && npm start  

- Wait for the REPL to be initialized.
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)  
- press the button in the middle of the page and watch the console
- press the button on the breadboard and watch the browser window
