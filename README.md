Johnny Five is alive  
====================

Examples for the workshop ["Johnny Five is Alive"](https://incom.org/workspace/6174) @ the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam (Germany).  

>Terms such as IOT, "Web of Things" or "Connected Devices" are used in an inflationary way in online and offline media. It is claimed that in 5 years 25 to 75 billion objects will be connected to the Internet. In order to develop prototypes for this field we require a toolkit that allows to mold hardware control and software from a single source.

### Issues 

The latest Nodejs version (4.1.0) seem to have problems with the serialport module. We need to fallback to a working version (0.12.7 stable). Use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install different versions.  

### Examples  

The project contains 4 examples.  

- [blink](blink/)  
- [button](button/)  
- [potentiometer](potentiometer/)  
- [servo](servo/)
